          Hi, my name is Sander. I was born and raised in the Netherlands and
          have been living in Stockholm, Sweden since the end of 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a background in business & IT. For my Bachelor degree I studied
          Business Information Systems at the Dundalk Institute of Technology in
          Dundalk, Ireland. Following this I got a Master in Strategic IT
          Management at Stockholm University, Sweden.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then I have worked several jobs, mostly on the edge between
          business and IT. It wasn't until early 2020 that I decided to pivot my
          career into web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had coded here and there before, during university and at times in
          my free time, but never full-time. In February 2020, I started the Le
          Wagon bootcamp in Stockholm as part of the first batch. The bootcamp
          focused on Ruby on Rails as a full-stack framework and also included a
          lot of concepts such as OOP, TDD and more. It laid a very good
          foundation for me to continue on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since finishing the bootcamp, I have been working as a teaching
          assistant for the following batch, helping new students discover the
          wonders of Ruby, while I am looking for my first job as a full-stack
          developer. In addition I have been diving into React and more
          Javascript, which I am really enjoying.
